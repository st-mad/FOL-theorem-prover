Here’s a **complete method to implement a first-order logic (FOL) theorem prover**, using the **resolution refutation** approach—arguably the most elegant and general-purpose method. It’s a classic in automated theorem proving, and it ties together logic, unification, parsing, and algorithmic reasoning.

# 🧠 Overview: First-Order Logic Theorem Prover via Resolution

Your goal is to **prove that a statement `φ` follows from a knowledge base `KB`**, i.e., that:

$$
KB \models φ
$$

This is equivalent to checking **unsatisfiability** of:

$$
KB ∪ \{\neg φ\}
$$

You do this using:

* **Clause conversion** (to CNF)
* **Skolemization**
* **Unification**
* **Resolution**
* **Looping until contradiction or no progress**

# ✅ High-Level Steps

## Step 1: Parse Input

Input should be FOL formulas like:

```text
∀x (Man(x) → Mortal(x))
Man(Socrates)
⊢ Mortal(Socrates)
```

**Action**: Parse formulas into an internal term tree structure.

---

## Step 2: Negate the Goal and Add to KB

Negate the goal `φ` and add it to `KB`. You’ll try to derive a contradiction.

```text
Goal: Mortal(Socrates)
Add ¬Mortal(Socrates) to the knowledge base
```

---

## Step 3: Convert All Formulas to Clausal Form (CNF)

Apply the following in sequence:

1. **Eliminate implications**

   * `P → Q` becomes `¬P ∨ Q`
2. **Move NOTs inward** (De Morgan)
3. **Standardize variables apart**
4. **Move quantifiers out** (Prenex form)
5. **Skolemize** (remove ∃ with functions)
6. **Drop universal quantifiers**
7. **Distribute ∧ over ∨ to get CNF**
8. **Split conjunctions into separate clauses**

Each clause becomes a disjunction of literals (e.g., `¬Man(x) ∨ Mortal(x)`)

---

## Step 4: Implement Unification (Robinson's Algorithm)

You’ll need this to determine whether two literals unify (e.g., `P(f(x))` and `P(y)`).

**Output**: A substitution `{x → y}`, or failure.

Use occurs-check to prevent cycles like `x → f(x)`.

---

## Step 5: Apply Resolution Rule

Resolution on clauses like:

```text
C1: A ∨ L
C2: ¬L ∨ B
```

If `L` and `¬L` **unify**, apply substitution and return:

```text
(A ∨ B)[θ]
```

You’ll do this for all pairs of clauses.

---

## Step 6: The Resolution Loop

```python
clauses = set(CNF_clauses)
new = set()

while True:
    for (Ci, Cj) in all_unique_clause_pairs(clauses):
        resolvents = resolve(Ci, Cj)
        if {} in resolvents:  # empty clause → contradiction
            return "Theorem Proved"
        new.update(resolvents)

    if new ⊆ clauses:
        return "Not Proved"
    clauses.update(new)
```

# 🧱 Implementation Plan (Modules)

### 1. **Parser** (`parser.py`)

* Converts text formulas to AST or term trees
* Handles quantifiers, logical operators, functions, constants

### 2. **Term Representation** (`terms.py`)

```python
class Variable: name
class Constant: name
class Function: name, args
class Predicate: name, args
```

### 3. **Substitution and Unification** (`unify.py`)

* Implements Robinson’s algorithm
* Substitutes terms into predicates
* Handles occurs-check

### 4. **Clause and CNF Converter** (`cnf.py`)

* Applies the 7-step transformation pipeline to turn formulas into CNF
* Standardizes variables
* Skolemizes existentials

### 5. **Resolution Engine** (`resolution.py`)

* Matches complementary literals using unification
* Resolves two clauses into resolvents
* Tracks clause history for proof trace

### 6. **Main Prover Loop** (`prover.py`)

* Reads KB + query
* Negates query
* Converts all to CNF
* Runs resolution loop
* Returns `proved` or `not proved`
